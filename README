twikrad is a hack and slash port of wikrad.

wikrad was created by Luke Closss and others at Socialtext
for access Socialtext Workspaces.

twikrad is for accessing TiddlyWeb in a similar way.

With any luck common ground and can be abstracted out and
a adaptation layer will be created so wikrad and twikrad can
share code, but efforts to do that initially proved problematic
as the code was insufficiently layerd.
