twikrad is a hack and slash port of wikrad.

wikrad was created by Luke Closs and others at Socialtext
for access Socialtext Workspaces.

twikrad is for accessing TiddlyWeb in a similar way.

With any luck common ground and can be abstracted out and
a adaptation layer will be created so wikrad and twikrad can
share code, but efforts to do that initially proved problematic
as the code was insufficiently layerd.

This is alpha software and sure to be full of confusion,
but it can do the job.
